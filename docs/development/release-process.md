# Agent reference: Cutting a release

A release is four artifacts that must agree: the **version string** (in two files), a **notes file** under [`docs/releases/`](../releases/), an **annotated git tag**, and a **GitHub Release**. This doc is the checklist for producing all four consistently. Releases are the one place where a commit lands on `main` without a PR — that exception is deliberate and scoped to the version bump only (see §The direct-to-main exception).

## The version string lives in exactly two files

Both must be bumped together and kept identical:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → `plugins[0].version`

Nothing else in the repo encodes the version (no README badge, no `__version__`). If you add a third location, add it here too. To confirm before bumping:

```
grep -rn '"version"' .claude-plugin/
```

## Steps

1. **Start from a fresh `main`.** Releases must include everything merged. Rebase the worktree:

   ```
   git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. **Run the full test suite — it must be green.**

   ```
   python3 -m unittest discover tests
   ```

3. **Pick `X.Y.Z`.** Patch (`Z`) for fixes, docs, and packaging; minor (`Y`) for new guarded commands or hook surface; major (`X`) for a default-behavior change. Most releases are patch. The notes file is named after it, so the choice comes first.

4. **Write the notes to `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` and land them through a pull request (PR).** See §Release notes for drafting the body and [`docs/releases/README.md`](../releases/README.md) for what belongs in the file. Landing them before the bump is what puts a tag's own notes inside the tagged commit, and it is the only step that gets the prose reviewed.

5. **Bump both version files** to `X.Y.Z`.

6. **Commit the bump alone** — no other changes in this commit:

   ```
   git commit -am "chore(release): bump version to X.Y.Z"
   ```

7. **Push the bump straight to `main`** (see §The direct-to-main exception):

   ```
   git push origin HEAD:main
   ```

8. **Tag the bump commit** with an annotated tag whose message is just the version:

   ```
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z" <bump-commit-sha>
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

   **Both pushes need an interactive permission mode.** branch-guard confirms any push whose target isn't the worktree branch, which covers `main` *and* the tag. Under `auto`/`dontAsk` there is nobody to answer, so both are denied outright — retrying won't help. Run the session interactively, or hand the two commands over to be run in a terminal. Create the tag in its own command: chained as `git tag … && git push …`, the deny takes out the `git tag` too and the tag never gets created.

9. **Create the GitHub Release** on that tag, marked latest, from the notes file:

   ```
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --latest --notes-file docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md
   ```

   Never pass `--notes` inline or leave the body to the web form — that is the habit this file layout exists to break. To correct a published body, fix the file, land the fix, and re-publish with `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`.

## The direct-to-main exception

Feature and fix work goes through PRs; the release bump does **not**. The bump commit is pushed directly to `main` and then tagged. This matches every prior release (`v1.0.0`, `v1.0.1`, `v1.0.2`) and keeps the tag pointing at a commit that exists on `main` with no merge-commit indirection.

This is the *only* sanctioned direct-to-main push. It is narrow by design: a two-line version bump with no logic. Anything bundled with substantive code would need a PR — so keep the bump commit pure. The standing rules still hold: never force-push `main`, and never bundle unrelated changes into the bump.

## Release notes

Every published body is in [`docs/releases/`](../releases/), so read a real one rather than guessing. [`v1.0.2.md`](../releases/v1.0.2.md) is the shape of a routine patch; [`v1.8.0.md`](../releases/v1.8.0.md) is the shape of a large release — grouped sections, a `> [!IMPORTANT]` callout for a behavior change an upgrader will feel, and a closing line stating what was validated.

The invariants:

- A one-line intro summarizing the release theme (e.g. "Patch release: a parsing hardening fix and docs improvements.").
- A bullet per notable PR: `* <title> by @<author> in <PR-url>`. Curate — highlight user-facing changes; routine chores can be folded into the changelog link.
- A trailing `**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/karlkfi/claude-workspace-guard/compare/v<PREV>...vX.Y.Z` line. It 404s until the tag is pushed; that is expected while the notes PR is in review.

To enumerate what shipped since the last tag:

```
git log --oneline v<PREV>..HEAD
```

For a first draft in the bullet shape, generate the notes into the file directly. This endpoint only computes a body — it creates and modifies nothing, so it is safe to run before the tag exists:

```
gh api repos/karlkfi/claude-workspace-guard/releases/generate-notes \
  -f tag_name=vX.Y.Z -f previous_tag_name=v<PREV> --jq .body > docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md
```

Then write the intro, prune the bullets, and group them. Do not reach for `gh release create --generate-notes`: it publishes an unreviewed body and leaves no file behind.

## Anti-patterns to watch for

- **Bumping only one of the two version files.** They must stay identical; a mismatch ships a marketplace listing that disagrees with the installed plugin.
- **Routing the bump through a PR.** The established flow is direct-to-main; a PR adds a merge commit the tag then has to point around.
- **Bundling code or docs into the bump commit.** That turns the sanctioned direct-to-main push into an unsanctioned one. Land everything else first, then bump.
- **Tagging before pushing the bump.** Push `main` first, then tag the commit that's now on `main`, so the tag is never orphaned on a branch.
- **Skipping the GitHub Release.** A tag without a Release breaks the "Full Changelog" chain and the Latest marker; every prior tag has a matching Release.
- **Writing the body anywhere but the file.** An inline `--notes`, a `--generate-notes`, or a paste into the web form all ship prose nobody reviewed and leave `docs/releases/` missing a version. Same for fixing a typo on github.com: the file is the source of truth, so the next `--notes-file` publish reverts the fix silently.
- **Bundling the notes PR into the bump commit.** The notes are ordinary docs and go through review; the bump stays a pure two-line change. Land the notes first, then bump.
