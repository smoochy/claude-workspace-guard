    keeps shlex's input to shell syntax only. The `<<WORD` operator and its
    delimiter stay on the command line, so the redirect handling in
    ``files_in_command``, the `<<`-delimiter skip there, and the
    ``'<<' not in tokens`` propagation guard are all unchanged; a trailing
    `<<EOF > out` redirect still parses. The body and its terminator line are
    dropped.

    Command-line quote state is tracked so a `<<` inside a quoted string is not
    mistaken for a heredoc; an unquoted `#` comment is skipped for `<<`
    detection (its text is left for ``strip_comments`` to remove). Arithmetic
    `$((a<<b))` / `((a<<b))` regions are copied verbatim — their `<<` is a shift,
    not a redirection, so they never arm a bogus delimiter. `<<<` here-strings
    are a distinct operator and never match. A `<<` with no delimiter word arms
    nothing; an unterminated body swallows to end-of-input, both matching bash.

    Flag handling is explicit (never inferred at runtime) and spans GNU + BSD.
    Short flags may be clustered (``-dp DIR`` == ``-d -p DIR``): each character

    token) as its directory and terminating the run.
      * ``-p DIR`` / ``-pDIR`` / ``--tmpdir=DIR``: DIR is the target directory

        ``=`` — a bare ``--tmpdir`` uses the default location per GNU's
        optional-argument rule, leaving a following token as a template).
      * ``-t``: GNU (no argument) and BSD (``-t prefix``, one argument) both
        resolve to the default host-temp location, so its presence alone marks
        the target host temp regardless of any following token.
      * ``-V`` / ``--version`` / ``--help``: informational, create nothing ->

      * ``-d``/``--directory``, ``-u``/``--dry-run``, ``-q``/``--quiet``,

      * a template with a ``/`` names its own location; a bare-name template (or
        none at all) uses the default location.

    ``default_dir`` overrides the fallback location for the default-location
    branch (bare / ``-t`` / bare-name template) — it carries a literal inline
    ``TMPDIR=`` prefix captured by :func:`inline_tmpdir`. An explicit ``-p`` /

    substitution (issue 84).

    Extends the issue-59 cd-target resolution to file operands and redirect
    targets: ``cp x "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/backup/"`` — the prefix is
    the same deterministic value bash computes, so the hook substitutes it and
    lets the concatenated remainder classify normally. Only a substitution at
    the START of the token is handled. The resolved value is STRING-concatenated
    with the remainder (matching bash — no path separator is inserted, so
    ``$(pwd)x`` becomes ``<pwd>x`` not ``<pwd>/x``), which means any ``$``/``~``
    or further substitution left in the remainder still trips the caller's
    ``EXPANSION_RE`` / tilde checks and keeps the runtime-expanded ``ask``. An
    unresolvable substitution (no ``.git`` boundary, git-discovery env vars set)
    returns ``tok`` unchanged, keeping the secure default. The caller gates this
    on a known ``group_cwd`` — ``pwd``/toplevel both depend on it.
